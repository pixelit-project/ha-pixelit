# PixelIt Liveview

A custom **Home Assistant integration** that mirrors the live content of a [PixelIt](https://github.com/pixelit-project/PixelIt) matrix display — the clock, bitmaps, text, everything you see on the physical display — as a mini pixel grid on a Lovelace card.

Unlike a naive direct-connection approach, this reads the display content **through Home Assistant**, so it works everywhere: on the desktop, in the Companion App over **Nabu Casa (remote/https)**, and on any network.

This integration is maintained by the [PixelIt project](https://github.com/pixelit-project) in [pixelit-project/ha-pixelit](https://github.com/pixelit-project/ha-pixelit).

## Features

- **Live pixel mirror** — Shows exactly what the PixelIt display is currently showing (rendered from the real LED pixels, ~250ms updates)
- **Works over Nabu Casa / remote** — Uses a HA sensor, not a direct device WebSocket, so it works in the Companion App and from outside your LAN
- **Self-healing connection** — Automatically reconnects if the PixelIt WebSocket goes stale (e.g. after a color change in the PixelIt WebUI)
- **Automatic card registration** — The Lovelace card is registered as a resource automatically, no manual setup
- **Config flow** — Configure IP, port and matrix size via the HA UI, no YAML editing
- **Theme-compatible** — Transparent background, adapts to any HA theme (including glass/Frosted Glass themes)
- **Connection status badge** — Shows "Connected" / "Disconnected"
- **Multi-language** — English and German UI (auto-detects HA language)

## Installation

### Marketplace / HACS (recommended)

1. Add `https://github.com/pixelit-project/ha-pixelit` as a custom repository in Marketplace (HACS on earlier Home Assistant versions) as an **Integration**
2. Install
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → PixelIt Liveview**
5. Enter the PixelIt IP, port and matrix size
6. Add the card to your dashboard (it's auto-registered as a resource)

### Manual

1. Copy the `custom_components/pixelit_liveview/` folder to your `config/custom_components/`
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → PixelIt Liveview**
4. Enter the PixelIt IP, port and matrix size
5. Add the card to your dashboard

In storage mode, the integration registers the dashboard resource automatically and updates the old `/local/pixelit-liveview-card.js` resource on upgrade. If your dashboard resources are managed in YAML, set the resource URL to `/pixelit_liveview/pixelit-liveview-card.js` with type `module`.

## Configuration

The integration is configured via the **config flow** (HA UI), no YAML needed. When you add the integration you are asked for:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **PixelIt display IP address** | The IP of your PixelIt (e.g. `192.168.178.8`) |
| **WebSocket port** | Default `81` |
| **Matrix width in pixels** | Width in pixels (e.g. `32`) |
| **Matrix height in pixels** | Height in pixels (e.g. `8`) |

> Note: The labels are shown in German if your Home Assistant language is German, otherwise in English.

Each display has its own sensor. Home Assistant derives new entity IDs from the display name. Registered entity IDs stay the same. The card editor preselects the sensor when exactly one PixelIt sensor is available. If you have several displays, choose the matching sensor. The live frame is sent as a compact `hex` attribute and excluded from Recorder history. The card also supports the older `pixels` attribute when connected to an earlier integration version.

To change the address, port, or dimensions, open the PixelIt Liveview integration entry and choose **Reconfigure**. Existing cards retain their sensor assignment.

### Card Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `entity` | string | Automatically selected when exactly one PixelIt sensor is available | Sensor exposing the liveview data |
| `gap` | int | 1 | Gap between pixels (px) |
| `title` | string | `PixelIt` | Card title |
| `show_header` | bool | true | Show card title |
| `show_status` | bool | true | Show connection status badge |
| `show_pixels` | bool | true | Show the pixel grid |

## How it works

1. The integration opens a WebSocket to `ws://<pixelit-ip>:81`.
2. PixelIt streams its live pixels as `{"liveview":"<hex>"}` (~6 hex chars per pixel, row by row).
3. The integration validates the frame and publishes it as the sensor’s `hex` attribute.
4. The card decodes the frame and renders the pixels as a grid, stretching to fill the card width while keeping pixels square.
